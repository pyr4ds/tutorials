# Python & R For Data Science Tutorial Materials  

Welcome to **PyR4DS** channel. In this channel, we will be exploring applications of `Python` and `R` programming languages in Data Science with practical examples and lab sessions.  

During the course of this exercise, we will not only use `Python` and `R` but also *employ a mix of other technologies* that compliment our base programming languages and in conjunction help us arrive at optimal data science pipeline with all components stitched effectively!  

The sessions are arranged as follows:  

1. An Introduction to R  
		- Getting started with R  
		- Object types in R  
		- Data importing and exporting  
		- Writing own functions  
		- Installing and using open source packages  
1. Understanding Your Data
		- Data Types  
		- Common Data Formats
